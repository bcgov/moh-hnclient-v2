# Based on client-auth-type value the properties from one of the two authentication methods will be used:

# Client authentication method #1: Client ID and Secret
# Client ID and secret are specified as environment variables. The default env var names are:
#	MOH_HNCLIENT_ID 
#	MOH_HNCLIENT_SECRET
# Multiple installations of the HN Client on the same machine is possible. To do so set the following 'client-env' property. If set 
# the client ID and secret will be taken from env vars that have the value of 'client-env' suffixed to them e.g. For Test set it to "TEST" and the 
# env var names will be: 
#	MOH_HNCLIENT_ID_TEST 
#	MOH_HNCLIENT_SECRET_TEST
# If not left blank allowed values are: TEST, VC1, TRN, PROD
client-env = TEST

# For development use only, the Client ID can be specified here but this is not to be used for local 
# installations on clients machines. Instead please use environment variables as described above.

# Client authentication method #2: Client ID with Signed JWT
## jks-key-alias should be the same as client id in keycloak
