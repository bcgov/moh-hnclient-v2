<!--
 This is an example of a HNCLient Windows Service Wrapper configuration, which includes only mandatory options.
 
 This configuration file should be placed near the WinSW executable, the name should be the same.
 E.g. for HNClient-Service.exe the configuration file name should be  HNClient-Service.xml
 
 You can find more information about the configuration options here: https://github.com/winsw/winsw/releases/tag/v2.11.0 sample-minimal.xml
 and sample-allOptions.xml

 To install multiple HNS Clients on the same machine edit the "id", "name" and "description" properties to a name that reflects your HNS Client instance's purpose e.g. HNS-Client-test for communicating with 
 the HN Secure test instance. Change the "name" and "description" properties as appropriate also.	
 
 -propertiesLocation option loads the external properties file from the classpath or file system
